//I've included a basic particle system. This is basically almost the same as
//the one used in R Funko CZ / ShinyTrem and so this one is basically a
//orange particle that flies and deposits smaller orange particles (missilePS)
//When it hits a surface (impactPS) it will spit out small orange particles in
//a random direction.
//Commented areas are shown to explain each step.
//Best you use C highlighting mode when viewing this file.
